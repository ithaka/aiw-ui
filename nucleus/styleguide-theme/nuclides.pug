        Nuclides are parts of the stylesheet source that are not directly useable on their own. This could be mixins, variables like colors and sizes, or settings.
      p.
        To mark a variable or mixin as a nuclide, annotate it with the <span class="SG-strong">@nuclide</span> tag, followed by the name of the nuclide.
      p.
        Special forms are <span class="SG-strong">@color</span> and <span class="SG-strong">@mixin</span>.
